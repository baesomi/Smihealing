<div id="intro"><h3><b>â—† Exercise Regularly!</b></h3>
     <p>Regular exercises reduce stress and anxiety, and the effects last longer than taking antidepressants.<br/>
          This effect appears because exercises improve the activity of endorphins.</p><p>
          Endorphin helps relieve depression by improving immunity and reducing awareness of pain by reducing awareness of pain. <br/>
          Norepinephrine, one of the neurotransmitters, is excreted through the exercise and eases symptoms of depression.
