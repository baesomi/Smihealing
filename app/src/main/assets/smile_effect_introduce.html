    <p style="color:gray; font-style:italic;">Putting on a happy face doesn't just make you more likeable; it makes you healthier, both good for your career.<br/><br/><br/><p/><p>
        We know smiling can greatly improve your mood and reduce stress. Even better, your smile doesn't have to be real, so you can fake it and still get the same results.
    <br/><br/>Smiling doesn’t just benefit you on the inside. It also works to your advantage from the outside.
        A study from Penn State University found that people who smile appear to be more likeable, courteous. and even competent.
        This is reason enough to smile at every person you potentially want to do business with. Lifting those facial muscles into a smile is also contagious;
        if you smile and they smile, everyone in the room becomes a little happier. Researchers at Uppsala University in Sweden concluded that
        frowning when looking at someone smiling is possible, but would be very difficult.<br/><br/>
        When you smile, your brain is aware of the activity and actually keeps track of it.
        The more you smile, the more effective you are at breaking the brain's natural tendency to think negatively.
        If you smile often enough, you end up rewiring your brain to make positive patterns more often than it does negative ones.<br/><br/>
        The more we train, the easier it becomes to think positively, shut out negativity, and,
        in turn, boost your productivity and creativity,which allows you to perform better at work and life.
        <br/><br/>
        Yes, all of those benefits can come from a simple smile.
        The more you do it, the more signals your brain will have to mentally shift to positive thoughts
        even when you might be in a situation that would normally cause you alarm.<br/><br/>……．
